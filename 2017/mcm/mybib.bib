The classic bottleneck theory is extended to include a uniformly distributed capacity and the commuters’ equilibrium departure patterns are derived for two different merging rules. The results show that uncertainty in the bottleneck capacity increases the commuters’ mean trip cost and lengthens the peak period, and that the system total cost is lower under give-way merging than under a fixed-rate merging. Capacity paradoxes with dynamic user responses are found under both merging rules. "
