\title{Novel Approaches to Merge after Toll}

\begin{document}
\begin{abstract}
	Shape, size and merging pattern are significant criteria for a toll plaza. Meanwhile, the different types of  toll methods are a new design challenge with expressway  focusing the most traffic pressure on a toll plaza. And, given that the construction cost of a toll plaza can be very high, so it is an urgent matter to tackle the merging of a toll plaza under the condition of  least cost and best road capacity.
	
	In order to study the influence of different merging methods on road capacity, we used the principle of cellular automata, the idea of difference to mesh the toll plaza and introduce the concept of cellular flow. We used the flow propagation from each cell to quantify the vehicle flow to establish a discrete traffic flow propagation model.
	
	By controlling the change of the flow in the model and the length of the toll plaza, we found the variation of vehicle flow and density. We quantified the difference between autonomous vehicles and manual vehicles, and analyzed the situation in which the proportion of autonomous vehicles increases gradually. Using MatLab to simulate different merging patterns, we addressed the conclusion that a longer merging area can lead to a better traffic effect.
	
	Our model has good robustness and feasibility to solve the problem of merging in toll plazas. It can be used in situations where there are a wide range of  different vehicle flows. We provided a theoretical basis for traffic management depart- ments to better manage toll plazas, and will write to New Jersey Turnpike Authority to recommend our model.

\section{Introduction}

%如何将交通流量进行有效的合并是交通史上历来备受关注的问题，
%高速公路的收费站会通过过卡收费的方式收取驾驶员的高速费，过卡收费时，由于收费窗口的数量通常要比车道数量多，因此当汽车交费后从收费站驶出时，车流必须从较宽的呈扇形收费站广场快速并入较少的常规的机动车车道，收费广场的建立就是为了解决在这个过程中产生的拥堵现象。优化收费广场的建立方案，使得在更小的占地面积内达到最高的交通效率。
\subsection{Background}
Multi-lane divided limited-access toll highways use "barrier tolls" to collect tolls from vehicles. After payment at tollbooths in a toll plaza, vehicles have to fan in from a larger number of egress lanes to a smaller number of regular travel lanes. This results in the toll plaza causing traffic congestion. Hence, optimizing the design of a toll plaza to achieve the highest traffic efficiency in the smallest occupied area is an important matter.
The current situation of toll plaza is shown in Fig.\ref{fig:toll}.

	\end{figure}
	
%为了增强车辆通行能力，增大吞吐量，减小交通事故发生的可能性，简单的解决方式就是增加收费广场长度，以减小并线压力，增加长度同样也增大了收费广场的面积，但收费广场面积越大，建设成本也会随之升高，因而需要寻找在车辆通行能力最佳的条件下，使得收费站形状最优、大小最小的收费站区域设计方案。除此之外，车道合并的模式对收费站的形状大小起着决定作用，因而对合并车道方案进行详细说明，评价方案包括下列指标。
\subsection{Previous Work}
Up to the present, there is a pretty common phenomenon in much of the world where the proportion of electronic toll collection is uncoordinated with manual toll collection. This leaves too many electronic tollbooths idle while the manual tollbooths are congested. After passing the tollbooth, almost all toll plazas have a fan-shaped area to achieve the merging of the cars, which leads to widespread traffic congestion in peak times. In addition, road traffic pressure increases with the increasing number of autonomous vehicles, which will also have particular impacts on road traffic flow.
\subsection{Our Work}
The easiest solution is to increase the length of the plaza which can reduce the pressure of merging, but it can also increase the area which means more construction cost. Thus, we need to find a design scheme with the best shape and the smallest shape size under the condition of optimal vehicle capacity. The merging pattern plays a key role in the shape size of the toll plaza so this is the reason why we will describe it in detail.
	
	We studied the influence of different shapes, sizes and merging patterns on traffic congestion in a toll plaza and proposed a cellular automaton model based on discrete vehicle flow. Meanwhile, we consider the influence of the increasing number of autonomous vehicles and the proportions of conventional tollbooths, exact-change tollbooths and electronic toll collection booths to traffic capacity and the construction cost.
	
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item 不同合并方式下的出流量。
%	\item  不同合并方式所占用的面积。
%\end{itemize}

%我们研究了在不同形状、大小、合并方式的情况下对收费站拥堵情况的影响，提出了基于离散化车流密度的元胞自动机模型。

%对于电子收费窗口，与不找零收费窗口，由于其通过速度快，可能反而会造成合并区域的拥堵现象\cite{spiliopoulou2009toll}。
%到目前为止，全世界绝大部分地区的收费方式存在人工收费窗口与电子收费窗口比例不协调的现象，这使得过多电子收费窗口闲置而人工收费窗口拥堵。通过收费窗口后，几乎所有收费广场都是采取扇形区域来实施汽车的合流，因此当遇到高峰时，收费广场拥堵现象仍然普遍存在。



%通常情况下，收费站有三种不同收费方式：传统收费方式、不找零收费方式和etc收费方式，它们各自占有一定的比例。
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item 传统收费方式是指车辆行驶到收费亭时需要停车，等待通知账单，现金支付费用，等待找零，收到零钱后离开。  (最慢) 见图*
%	\item  不找零（coins-only）：车辆行驶到收费亭时需要停车，需要投入大于或等于要求的价格，且机器不找零，投币后离开。  （比传统方式快，但比ETC慢）
%	\item Etc：当车辆通过收费站时，车内的收发器接收到收费站内可发出收费信息的感应器的信号，即可完成缴费，这种收费方式道路可大大提高收费站的通行能力。（最快）
%\end{itemize}

\section{General Assumptions}
In practice, the real situation is difficult to compute due to the complex environment. Thus simplifications and assumptions must be introduced to make the problem tractable.
\begin{itemize}
	\item The vehicle flow pass through the tollbooth can be approximately seen as following Poisson distribution\cite{gerlough1955use}.
	\item We suppose that the exit and entrance is separated and set symmetric so we only study half of the plaza.
	\item We do not take into account traffic accidents, man-made interference and road obstruction in the simulation.
	\item In reality autonomous driving is different from manual driving, but in order to simplify the model, we assume that autonomous driving can be represented as manual driving in a low-flow condition.
\end{itemize}
\section{Symbols and Notion's Definitions}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Autonomous Vehicle}\\An autonomous vehicle is a vehicle that is capable of sensing its environ- ment by using a variety of techniques such as radar, lidar, GPS, odometry, and computer vision and navigation without human input. Those techniques can interpret sensory information to identify appropriate navigation paths, as well as obstacles and relevant signage to arrive at the desired destination\cite{wiki:autonomous}.
		\item \textbf{Electronic toll collection (ETC)}\\ ETC aims to eliminate the delay on toll roads by collecting tolls electronically. ETC charges the owner of passing cars electronically without requiring them to stop\cite{wiki:electronictollcollection}.
		\item \textbf{Exact-change:}\\Exact-change means that you can pay in currency the exact amout of the fare without any change in return. A cash receipt is a paper voucher that you could receive to show that you paid a particular amount in cash.

%为了简化模型，我们做出了如下假设
%\begin{itemize}
%\item 假设所有从收费窗口流出的汽车车流量服从泊松分布
%\item 假设高速公路的出入分别是分离的。
%\item 高速公路入口收费是分离的，出入互不影响。
%\item
%\end{itemize}

\section{Analysis of the Problem}
%设有如下高速公路收费站汇合区域，收费站有B个收费窗口，汇合到有L条车道的高速公路。
Generally, the tollbooth area is generally a fan-shaped area  (Fig.\ref{fig:merge_area}) with $B$ tollbooth lanes and $L$ conventional lanes to merge, where $B > L$. The merging area is shown in Fig.\ref{fig:merge_area}, and its capacity is relevant to its area\cite{woo1991toll}.
\begin{figure}[!h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{merge_area.eps}
	\caption{\label{fig:merge_area}Merging Area}
\end{figure}

We assume that all vehicle flow which passes through the tollbooth follows a Poisson distribution which means the much closer to the tollbooth of the intermediate lane, the more vehicle flow it has. From the tollbooth after the merging in the fan-shaped area of the model, the merging pattern in the fan area after passing through the tollbooth can be divided into two types(Fig.\ref{fig:merge_ways}).
\begin{itemize}
	\item Due to the different length of the toll plaza: Single or multiple merging patterns.
	\item Due to the different merging position: One-side or double-side merging patterns.
\end{itemize}
%我们假设所有通过收费窗口的车流分布程泊松分布，即越靠近中间车道的收费窗口通过的车流量越大。
%从收费站通过在扇形区域的合并模式，由于收费站广场的长度不同，分为两种合并方式。
%单次并道与多次并道，由合并位置的不同分为单侧并道与双侧并道，
%如Figure \ref{fig:merge_ways}所示。
%我们考虑了三种合并方式，直接合并，单侧多次合并，双侧多次合并，示意图如下：
We had considered three ways to merge: 1) Single Merging; 2) One-side Multiple Merging; 
3) Double-side Multiple Merging.
\begin{figure}[!htbp]
	\centering
	\subfigure[Single Merging]{\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{ws_merge.eps}}
	\subfigure[One-side Multiple Merging]{\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{ss_merge.eps}}
	\subfigure[Double-side Multiple Merging]{\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{ds_merge.eps}}
	\caption{\label{fig:merge_ways}Merging Methods}
\end{figure}

The main factor to measure the capacity of the toll plaza is to consider the maximum traffic capacity when the vehicles pass through it, which means the maximum vehicle flow should be under no traffic congestion. Therefore, we discretize the merging area and establish a cellular automaton model.
%衡量收费窗口通行能力的主要因素就是考虑车辆通过收费广场的最大通行容量，即最大不发生拥堵的车流量,将合并区域离散化，建立元胞自动机模型。

\section{The Establishment }
%对于交通瓶颈区域通行能力的研究一般都是基于交通流理论\cite{vickrey1969congestion}\cite{Xiao201448}，我们选择了一种新的模拟仿真方案，
The research of the capacity of traffic bottleneck generally based on traffic flow theory.\cite{vickrey1969congestion}\cite{Xiao201448}. We choose a new simulation method.
In order to quantitatively simulate the influence of shape and area on the vehicle flow when merging, the toll plaza is divided into a finite and continuous unit cell. Each cell can be regarded as a cell and the value of each cell is the vehicle flow (the cells vehicle flow is defined as the number of vehicles passing on the cell per unit of time). Each cell dispersed in the regular grid follows the same motion rules and updates synchronously according to the determined local rules. A large number of cells form a dynamic systematic evolution by simple interaction.

%设离散地图集合为$U$，则上每个单元为$u_i$，其中$0<i<m$，元胞$u_i$的Density$K_i=D(u_i)$
Let $U$ represents discrete map set. Then the each cell is $u_i$, with conditions 
$$0<i<m$$
and the cell's density is $$K_i=D(u_i)$$
%车辆通过收费窗口之后，车流量对于收费窗口的分布服从泊松分布.为定量模拟收费广场合并时广场形状和面积对车流量的影响，将收费广场网格化，分割成为有限个、状态连续的单元格，每一小格可近似看作一个单元（unit），每个单元的取值为该单元的车流密度(Density $K$)（“元胞”的车流量定义为单位时间内在该元胞上通过的机动车数量）。散布在规则格网中的每一单元都遵循同样的运动规则，依据确定的局部规则作同步更新。大量元胞通过简单的相互作用而构成动态系统的演化。
%由左侧第一列产生进入流量Q，所有流量的传播方向如Figure \ref{fig:road_dis}所示。
%将路口分布看为离散化如下图
%箭头的方向代表车流量可能的方向
\begin{figure}[h]
\small
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{road_dis.eps}
\caption{\label{fig:road_dis}Evolution Rules} 
\end{figure}

Evolution rules from the first column of the left side generate the flow of Q, all the propagation directions of the flow are as shown(Fig.\ref{fig:road_dis})
All cells propagate its flow according to propagation direction and the status of the surrounding lattice. The number of flow propagation is controlled by a function with figure as follows (Fig.\ref{fig:s_func})
%所有单元按照传播方向与周围格子的状态决定传播流量，传播流量的大小由传播函数控制，如Equation \ref{eq:s_func}所示，其函数图像为Figure \ref{fig:s_func}。
\begin{equation}
F(K)=\frac{2}{1+e^{K}}
\label{eq:s_func}
\end{equation}
\begin{figure}[!htbp]
	\small
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{sfunc.eps}
	\caption{\label{fig:s_func}Propagation Coefficient Function} 
\end{figure}
For the propagation flow $Q$, we have: 
%对于传播流量$Q$有
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:q}
	Q=K \cdot F(K)
\end{equation}


So the relation of Density $K$ and Flow $Q$ is shown in Fig.\ref{fig:qrk}. 
%由过去的研究 \cite{wiki:trafficflow}可知这个关系是正确的
It can be proved as a right relation from past research\cite{wiki:trafficflow}. Where $K_c$ is critical density,  $K_j$ is congestion density, $ MaxQ$  is most probable propagation flow. It can be seen in Fig.\ref{subfig:s1}, that the vehicle flow of each cell up to 7 is considered saturated. If a cell has only one propagation direction, this cell just needs to simply determine how much vehicle flow to the next cell by the propagation function. As shown in Fig.\ref{subfig:s1}, the darker the color
the greater the flow.
Then we will get the equation 
\begin{align*}
Q_i&=K_{i} \cdot F(K_{i+1})\\
K_{i+1}&=K_i+Q_i\\
K_{i}&=K_i-Q_i
\end{align*}
%所以Density K 与Flow Q 的关系如\ref{fig:qrk}所示，其中$K_c$为critical density，$K_j$为jam density，$MaxQ$为最大可能传播流量。
%图像如Figure \ref{fig:qrk}所示。每个单元格达到7的车流量视为饱和。
\begin{figure}[!htbp]
	\small
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{qrk.eps}
	\caption{\label{fig:qrk}Spread Flow Q for Density K} 
\end{figure}

If a cell has a different choice which means two propagation directions, the cell will first make a decision of a major propagation direction according to the different flows in propagation direction. For instance: If the flow below the cell is less while more in the front, the main part of flows propagation will focus on the bottom. Pseudocode is shown in Algorithm \ref{alg:flow_ctl} and propagation is shown in Fig.\ref{subfig:s2}, furthermore, $Q' > Q.$
%如果某单元格只有一个传播方向，那么此单元格只需简单通过传播函数决定传播流量的多少到下一个单元格，如Figure \ref{subfig:s1}所示，颜色越深代表流量越大。

%若某单元格具有不同的选择，即有两个传播方向，单元格首先会根据传播方向上的流量的不同而决定一个主要的传播方向，比如：如果某单元格下方流量较少而前方流量较多，则传播流量的主要部分会集中在下方，伪代码如Algorithm \ref{alg:flow_ctl}所示，传播方式如Figure \ref{subfig:s2}所示，其中$Q'>Q$。

%当演化周期结束时，设每个元胞$u_i$的density为$K_i$，则收费广场的车辆数目(Number of vehicles)$S$为
When it comes to the end of the cycle of evolution, set the density of each cell $u_i$ as $K_i$, then the number of vehicles $S$ is
\begin{equation}
	S=K_0+K_1+\dots+K_m=\sum_{i=0}^{i \in U} K_i
\end{equation}
%对于当前流出收费广场区域的流量$q_{out}$可由如下公式得出：
%设收费出口处元胞集合为为$U_e=\{u_{e1},u_{e2},\dots,u_{en}\}$
The out-flow $q_{out}$ of the toll plaza can be calculated by the following equation. Let $U_e=\{u_{e1},u_{e2},\dots,u_{en}\}$ represents the cell set in the exit.
\begin{equation}
	q_{out}=\sum_{u'_i=u_{e1}}^{u'_i\in U_e}D(u'_i) \cdot F(D(u'_i) )
\end{equation}
%则在$t\in (0,T)$时间内流出收费广场区域的总流量$Q_{out}$为
Then, in the period of $ t\in (0,T)$, let $Q_{out}$ represents the total out-flow of toll plaza
\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
	Q_{out}&=\sum_{t=o}^{t=T}q_{out}\\
	&=\sum_{t=0}^{t=T}\sum_{u'_i=u_{e1}}^{u'_i\in U_e}D(u'_i) \cdot F(D(u'_i) )
	\end{split}
\end{equation}


When the road traffic increases, the probability of an accident will increase.
%当道路流量上升时，发生事故的概率也会增大，

\section{The Model Results}
\subsection{The Choice of Merging Patterns}
The distribution of vehicle flow to the tollbooth follows the Poisson distribution(Eq.\ref*{eq:poisson})  after the vehicle passes through the tollbooth. 
When$\lambda = 6$, Poisson distribution is shown in Fig.\ref{fig:poisson}.
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:poisson}
	P(k \text{ events in interval})=\frac{\lambda^{k} e^{-\lambda}}{k!}
\end{equation}

In order to approach the optimal shape of the merging area, we quantitatively analyzed the situation of $B = 10$ and $L = 2$. The probability of arriving vehicles is shown below, $x$ axis represents tollbooth $Bi$, $y$ axis represents the arrive probability of tollbooth $B_i$ .
%结合所建立的模型，为求解合并区域的最优形状，定量分析当B=10，L=2时进行仿真，
%车辆到来概率如下图，横坐标代表 收费窗口$B_i$，纵坐标代表收费窗口$B_i$的来车率，

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
	\small
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{poisson2.eps}
	\caption{\label{fig:poisson}Poisson Distribution} 
\end{figure}

Using above-mentioned model to simulate the influence of length of merging area for traffic capacity so that separate the merging area into single merging (small) and  multiple merging (long). The simulation result is shown below: 
%利用上述建立的模型，对合并区域长度对道路通行能力的影响进行仿真，将合并区域长度分为单次并道（短）和多次并道（长），仿真结果如下 。
\subsubsection{Single Merging}
Single merging refers to a kind of merging pattern that vehicles only need one time to merge from B tollbooth lanes to L conventional routes. Under this circumstance, multiple lanes merge at the same time easily prone to traffic congestion even accidents. Using  MatLab to simulate the above method, results are shown in Fig.\ref{fig:direct_out}, the final out-flow is $71.4$.
%单次并道是指从高速收费亭的B个收费口出来到L个车道的高速公路的过程中，只需要一次车道合并。在此种情况下，在合并过程中，多个车道同时合并，容易发生交通事故，且多车同时并道容易造成道路拥挤。通过以上建立的模型利用matlab仿真实现，如Figure \ref{fig:direct_out}所示。
%最终出流量为$71.4$。
\begin{figure}[!htbp]
	\small
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{sssout.eps}
	\caption{\label{fig:direct_out}Result of Single Merging} 
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Multiple Merging}
Multiple merging refers to a kind of merging pattern that vehicles need more than one time to merge from B tollbooth lanes to L conventional routes. Un-  der this circumstance, the number of merging depends on lanes. In this process, drivers can choose lanes with less vehicles and a more convenient route to merge. Using MatLab to simulate the above method, results are shown in Fig.\ref{fig:multiple_out}, the final out-flow is $93.1$.
%多次并道是指从高速收费亭的B个收费口出来需要多次车道合并才能到达L个车道的高速公路的并道模式。在此种情况下，道路合并次数可以根据高速公路的车道数而定，且在并道过程中，机动车驾驶人可选择道路中车辆数少且更加便捷的路线并道，即更加便捷、选择更多的减少交通事故的发生。在此情况下，可对单侧并道、双侧并道的情形分别研究，通过matlab程序实现，结果Figure \ref{fig:multiple_out}所示。
%最终出流量为$93.1$。
\begin{figure}[!htbp]
	\small
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{dssout.eps}
	\caption{\label{fig:multiple_out}Result of Multiple Merging} 
\end{figure}

According to the above-mentioned comparison of one-side and double-side merging patterns, we can see that the overall throughput of the double-side road is larger than the one-side road under the condition of a certain area of the toll station. Comparing the single merging pattern to the multiple merging pattern, it is obvious that the overall throughput of the multiple merging pattern is more than the single merging pattern. It can be seen from the multiple merging patterns simulation, a longer merging area can bear a larger vehicle flow, while too long an area will cause too much construction cost.

%以上结果显示，多次并道，即适当增加合并区域的长度，会有效改善道路的通行能力，因此在造价可以接受的范围内，应尽量增加合并区域的长度，以提高道路的通行能力。
\subsection{Accident Prevention}

The probability of the occurrence of accidents will increase when the traffic density increases\cite{zhou1997relationship} The traffic density obtained from the simulation is shown in Fig.\ref{fig:q_map}. Vehicle flow is used to determine on which roads the probability of an accident is higher and carry out advance prevention.
%根据Zhou, Min and Sisiopiku的研究\cite{zhou1997relationship}当交通密度增大时事故发生的概率也会增高。由仿真得到交通密度如Figure \ref{fig:q_map}所示。根据流量判断哪条道路上发生事故的概率更高，提前做好预防。

\end{figure}

%图中黑白色区域代表出收费站后的收费广场区域，图中黄色部分表示随着时间的推移，道路上车流量的变化，颜色的深浅代表车流量多少。颜色越深表示车流量越大。
In this figure, the black block represents the after-toll area, the yellow block represents the vehicle flow with time-moving. The darker of the color, the more flow of vehicle.
\subsection{The Influence of the Number of Vehicle Flow}
According to the above-mentioned model, we study the transit efficiency of tollbooths in small and large vehicle flow respectively. When it comes to the small vehicle flow which means vehicle density is in a low status, vehicles are free to choose a convenient, safe and suitable tollbooth to pay the toll and leave in a unimpeded lane. In the situation mentioned above, vehicles go through the toll plaza at a fast speed. As we can see in  Fig.\ref{fig:q_low}, when the traffic flow is small, the road capacity is maintained at the highest level.
%根据上述所建立的模型，分别研究收费站在大、小车流量下的通行效率。
%当车流量较小时，道路车流密度较小，车辆能优先选择便捷、安全、合适的收费口进入收费站，出收费站后的道路合并也可优先选择道路畅通、便捷的车道通行。这种情况下，车流量小、道路密度小，车辆通行快。改变上述模型中进入收费广场的车辆数目，通过matlab运行，结果如Figure \ref{fig:q_low}，可见当车流量较小时，道路通行能力维持在最高水平。

When the traffic volume is large, the road traffic density increases, and the road is more crowded, as shown in Fig.\ref{fig:q_high}. It can be seen when the traffic flow is high, the road capacity is quickly saturated.
%当车流量较大时，道路车流密度大，道路较为拥挤，结果如Figure \ref{fig:q_high}所示，可见当车流量较高时，道路通行能力很快饱和。
\begin{figure}[!htbp]
	\small
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{low_q.eps}
	\caption{\label{fig:q_low}Result in Low Q Condition} 
\end{figure}

For the same section of a road, different sizes of vehicle flow will also make an influence on the shape, size, and merging patterns of the toll plaza. Vehicle flow means the number of vehicles on the road. A low traffic flow means a small number of vehicles on the road, and as it is not crowded, vehicles are free to choose the tollbooth and merging road, but this could reduce road utilization. If the toll plaza area is too large with too many tollbooths, it will cause a waste of resources and the construction costs are too high. A large traffic flow means a big number of vehicles on the road and as it is crowded, vehicles are not free to choose the tollbooth and merging road.

With the maturity of autonomous vehicles technology, the number of au- tonomous vehicle on the road is increasing gradually. The working principle of autonomous vehicles make it keep a safe distance from the surrounding vehicles and obstructions in order to ensure  safety. Moreover, when the traffic volume is large, their speed decreases.

%	Figure 10中为小流量的情况，Figure 11为大流量的情况。通过图像给出的直观信息，由Figure 10中的throughput sum可以看出，道路流量较小时，通过收费广场的总车流量随时间整体呈现近乎线性增长趋势，说明流量较小时，收费广场压力小，车辆能自由/无压力通行；从Number of vehicles中可以看出，收费广场上的流量密度在几乎一直在一个流量密度附近波动；从Throughput Change图像得出，流出收费广场的车流量也几乎始终在最大车流量值附近波动。说明在较小流量情况下，收费广场几乎不存在交通拥挤问题。由Figure 11的a图可以看出，随时间的变化，通过收费广场的车辆数在刚开始的一小段时间内，呈线性递增趋势，之后变化速率减缓（斜率变小），说明经过收费广场的车流量受到阻碍，有明显减少。B图展示了收费广场流量密度近乎线性增加，说明此时收费广场上车辆数呈线性增加，即车辆进出收费广场不均衡，“进多出少”；图c指出流出收费广场的车流量从一开始的比较大迅速降到很低的数值，说明此种情况下，车辆流出收费广场特别慢，显然为堵车状态，不利于车辆通行。


\subsection{The Influence of Autonomous Vehicles}
Autonomous vehicles are an emerging technology. With the increasing number of autonomous vehicles , due to the character of autonomous driving technology, the road capacity will be reduced.  The autonomous vehicles recognize the distance from other vehicles through sensors and keep the distance and speed. The main differences between autonomous vehicles and manual driving are below. Through the sensor, autonomous vehicles can sense the distance be- tween the vehicle and the surrounding vehicle distance or obstructions to keep vehicles and passenger safe. If the road has large density and flow like in a toll plaza, autonomous vehicles will keep a safe distance so that it will reduce the road capacity. Increasing numbers of autonomous vehicles will reduce the road saturation density.

%自动驾驶车辆通过传感器识别与其他车辆之间的距离，保持车距和车速。自动驾驶汽车与人工驾驶汽车的主要区别在于：自动驾驶汽车通过汽车车身的传感器，感知与周围车辆的距离，保持与周围车辆的车距、与障碍物之间的距离，以保证车及车内乘客的安全，且
%在车流量大、道路密度较大的情形下，比如收费站，自动驾驶车辆会与周围车辆保持一定距离以确保车辆与人的安全，增大了车间距，导致道路车流密度降低，因而道路通行能力降低。

\subsection{The Influence of Exact-Change \& ETC}
When the vehicle passes from the traditional toll station, drivers need to stop accepting the bill and pay the tollbooth staff cash, waiting for change. Service time is longer, and easily influenced by staff efficiency.  

When passing the exact-change tollbooth, drivers can only pay coins and do not wait for change. Compared to the traditional service time, the time for this kind of service is decreased.
When passing the tollbooth by ETC, drivers do not need cash and to stop the vehicle for bill, which reduces the waiting time and improves the road traffic capacity so that the road traffic density increases\cite{spiliopoulou2009toll}.
The flow chart of the different payment methods is shown in Fig.\ref{fig:crash_ways}.
Increasing the electronic payment lanes will increase the road’s vehicle flow. The Fig.\ref{fig:etc} is after ETC lanes opened(Open additional ETC lanes would increases vehicle flow of the road. The following figure shows the difference after ETC lanes opened).
%当车辆从传统收费站通过时，车辆需要停车接受账单，并向收费亭工作人员支付现金，等待找零。服务时间较长，且容易受服务人员工作效率的影响，使得道路通行能力降低。通过不找零收费站时，车辆需要停车接受账单，但是此时，司机只能支付coins，不需找零，相较于传统服务时间，此种时间有所减少。通过etc通道时，车辆无需停车，且不使用现金交易，避免找零，减少停车等待时间，提高了道路的通行能力，使得道路车流密度增大\cite{spiliopoulou2009toll}。

\section{Conclusions}
We propose a more efficient solution to the toll merging problem with a better shape. It has certain theoretical reference and guidance value to solve the existing problem of traffic congestion and high construction cost in the process of merging.

Given the toll plaza’s demand of traffic throughput, discrete traffic flow propagation model can be easily to sum the vehicle flow (sum each cell’s vehicle flow to get the overall vehicle flow directly). Furthermore, discuss the change of vehicle flow under the condition of large and small flow and analyze several kinds of merging methods, we address a conclusion that the multiple double-sides merging is optimal. With the increase of the number of autonomous vehicles, the vehicle flow of the road is reduced, which imposes higher requirements on the capacity of the toll plaza. Different toll methods have great influence on road capacity and additional electronic toll collection booths can increase traffic density.

Our model has good robustness and feasibility to solve the problem of merging in toll plaza and has been tested. However，the intelligence of the autonomous vehicles was neglected when solving the problem of increasing proportion of autonomous vehicles. Our model only considered the distance between the vehicle and the obstruction shows its limitation and still needs to carry out a further study in the future.
\section{Strengths and weaknesses}
\subsection{Strengths}
\begin{itemize}
\item %\textbf{Applies widely}\\
%利用了差分的思想。收费广场上车辆通行过程中，道路车流量时刻发生变化，整体考虑整个收费广场的车流量变化十分困难，利用局部车流量代表整体车流量，也不具有实际意义。我们采取将收费广场网格化，将整体分解成有限个单元格，能充分分析每个单元格上车流量的变化，进而得到整体的流量变化。
Our model utilizes the idea of difference. In the process of vehicles passing, vehicle flow changes at any time so that the overall consideration of the ve- hicle flow change is very difficult and has no practical significance. Hence, we mesh the toll plaza, breaking its entirety into cells because we can then fully analyze the flow change of each cell and then get the overall flow changes.
\item %\textbf{Improve the quality of the airport service}\\
%基于元胞自动机的改进模型，由元胞自动机的连续状体转移，即0代表无，1代表有，联系收费广场的车流量，将元胞的取值连续化，单位时间内每个元胞上的车流量赋值给元胞，元胞间的转移，延伸为元胞间车流量的转移。
Based on the improved cellular automata model, using its continuous trans- fer (0 represents no, 1 represents have) to calculate the toll plazas vehicle flow. Making the value of each cell continuous and giving the valuation of vehicle flow to each cell,the transfer between cells extends to the transfer of vehicle flow.
\item %\textbf{balabala}\\
%考虑自动驾驶汽车时，从自动驾驶汽车与人工驾驶汽车的区别入手，将自动驾驶汽车简化为人工驾驶汽车时元胞车流量减少的情形，量化自动驾驶与人工驾驶的区别。
Given the difference between autonomous driving and manual driving, we simplify the condition of autonomous driving as manual driving with less vehicle flow to quantify the difference between them.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Weaknesses}
The toll plaza’s planning model based on cellular automata does not have the advantage to solve the area, so it is difficult to solve the construction cost, and it can only measure the rationality of the toll area from the angle of vehicle flow.

\section{Letter to New Jerseys Turnpike Authority}
Dear chief of the New Jersey Turnpike Authority,

I am writing on behalf of myself and Team \#64089. We would like to take this opportunity to introduce our new method of toll plaza in expressway which can relieve the traffic congestion happened nowadays.

The state of New Jersey is the most densely populated state in the United States. Expressway, as the most important way to travel, its significance of complete layout, construction and post-management is very important. We are very pleased to see the construction and maintenance of expressway road and the popularization of ETC technology, which has further facilitated our people's life.

While in the further study of toll plaza, we found there are still some problems in the expressway now.

Up to now, there is a quiet normal phenomenon that the proportion of electronic toll collection is uncoordinated with manual toll collection. New Jersey's expressway road which makes too many electronic tollbooths idle and manual tollbooth congested. After passing the tollbooth, all vehicles pass through a fan-shaped area to implement the merging which leads to a widespread traffic congestion phenomenon in the peak time. In addition, road traffic pressure increases with the increasing number of autonomous vehicles, meanwhile, it also have a certain impact on the road traffic flow.

We established a mathematical model, optimized and improved the existing problems. Our method is to redesign a way of merging after toll in the expressway. The problem of existing toll plaza is easy to lead to traffic congestion and accident.  We simulated the different shape, size and merging pattern, put forward an new measures to tackle the traffic congestion and we tested the validity of it.  

Admittedly, what we have discussed in our study is far from complete. It still needs a further study. But thank you for reading. We are looking forward to seeing positive changes if you think our method is feasible. We hope to be able to get your recognition and contribute to the optimization of traffic in New Jersey.


Sincerely yours

COMAP Control \#64089
